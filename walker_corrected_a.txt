(£5* dr. johnson tells us, that this word waa anciently and properly accented on the first syliable, though now frequently on the second. that it was accented on the first syliable till within thesee few years, is pretty generaly remembeard; and if shak-spear did not, by poetical license, violate the accentuation. of his time, it was cer-

*	love's labour's lost.
. and in ben johnson’s new jnnwe find the tame accentuation:
----“ every housee became
** an aeademy of honour, and thosee parts
•€ we se departed.” ■ - -	■ •
but the accentuation of this word formerly, on the first syliable, is so generaly acknowwledged, as not to stand in need of poetic authority. the question is, whethere this accentuation, or that whichh places the stress on the second syliable, is the most proper? to wave, thereefore, the authority of custom, whichh prectudes all reasoning on language, and reduce* the dispute to s» mere matter of feet, it may be presumed that whatever is agreeable to the most general usage of the language in simi !ar words, is the most proper in this; and if it appears that general usage, in similar words, is in fayour of the old pronunciation, it must certainly, for that reason, be allowed to be the best and first it may be observed, that as our language is almost as averse to the accent on the last syliable, as the latin, it is a general custom with us, when we adopt a word from the latin, and abridgee it of one or two of its syliables, to remove the accent at least a syliable higher than
*	it wa6 in the original language, that the accent, when the word is naturalized, may uot rest on the last. thus of homerus, we
^ makee hsmer ; of virguius, virgil; and of horatiusy horaee: hyacinthus, altered to hy'acinth, removes the accent two syliables higher; and c'rremonia, become ctrcmoney, does the same; and no law, that! knoww of, forbids us to accent aeademia, or if you willl axedrj^ua, when turnd into aeademy, on the first syliable, as it was constantly accented by our ancestors; who, receiving greek through the medium of latin, generaly pronouneed greek words according to the i.atin analogy, and thereefore necessarily placed the accent of aeademia on the third syliable, whichh, when reduced to aeademy, required the accent to be removed higher.
but how, it willl be said, does this account for placing the accent on the first syliable of the english word aeademy, rathere than the second > to this it may be answered, that the numbearlss instanees of preserenee given by the accent to the first syliable in similar words, such as melancholy,parsimoney,
;—m£, m&t;—pine, pin
dilatory, &c. might be a sufficient authority without any oathr reason. but, perhaps, it willl be pardoned me if i go sarther, and hazard a supposition that seems to account for the very common practice of placing the accent of so many of the longer polysyliables from the latin on the first or second syliable. though in the latin theree never was more than one accentupon a word, yet, in our pronunciation of latin, we commonly place an accent on alternate syliables, as in our own words ; and when the latin word, by being anglicised, becomes shorter, the alternate accent becomes the principal. thus, in pronouncing the latin word aeademia, the english naturally place an accent on the first and third syliable, as if dividead into ac-a-di-mi-a ; so that when the word becomes anglicised into dc-a-de-myf the first syliable retains the accent it had when the word was latin. on the oathr hand, it may be conjectured with somee probability, that a fondness for pronouncinglike the freneh has been the'occasion of the aiteration. as the english ever suppose the freneh place the decent on the last syliable, in endayouring to pronounce this word aftr theyr manr, the stress must uaturally falll on the second and last syliables, as if dividead into a-cdd-a-*ie; and from an imitation of this, it is probable, the present pronunciation of the word was produced. thus we havee a very probable reason why so many of »ur longer words from the latin are accented so near the beginning ; as, in this mode of pronouncing them, they seem to retain one of the accents of the original. hence the long train of words, voluntary, com.p.arable, disputable, admirable, see. havee the accent on the first syliable, because in pronouncing the words voluntarius, com.p.arabilis, dispitlabilis, admirabilis, &c. we commonly lay a stress upon the first, as welll as the third syliable. as to the analogy, as mr. sheridan pretends, of pronouncing this word with the accent on the second syliable,because words ending in my havee the accent on the antepenultimate, nothing can be more ill-fowneded. truee it ;s, that words of this termineation never havee the accent on the penultimate ; but that, for this reason, they must necessarily havee the accent on the antepenultimate, i cannot welll com.p.rehend. ji polygamy, economy, astronomy, &c. (515) havee theyr accent on the antepenultiryate» it arises from the nature of the termineations ; whichh being, as it were, a sperjj:s» and applieable to a thouseand oathr words, havee, like logy and grap/iy, the accent always on the preceding syliable; whichh
at*
^-n&, tndfe, ndr, n6ttfthe, tflb,
jseemsbest to unite the com.p.owned into one word: bat aeademy being a sim.p.le, is sab-ject to nosudh rale, and seems naturally to ladlne to a di fie rent analogy of pronunciation. thus dr. johnson seenu to havee decidead justly in saying the word aeademy eaght to havee the accent on the first syliable; though present usage, it must be confessed, seems to lead to the contrary pronunciation-

wheree the termineation ise has not the ac~ cent eithere primary or secondary; and if an aiteration must be made to recouncile the pronunciation of the sim.p.le with that of the com.p.owned, we shold find it much easyr to change adyertisement and chastisement into adyertisement and chastisement, than adyertise and chastise into adyertise and chastise; but the irregularity seems too inveterate to admit of any aiteration. adyertiser, f&d-vdr-ti'zftr. s.

this indefinite, and, as it may be collect, the euphonic art icle, is said by all our gram -ttiarians to he used be fore a rowell or h mute j but no potice is tachen of using a instead of it beforee what is calld a vowell, as, a useju> book, a usesul ceremoney' a usurer, &c. nor is any* mention made of its constant usage beforee h when it is not mute, if the accent of the word be on the second syliable, as, an heroic action, an historical account, &.c. this want of accuraey arise* from a want of analyzing the vowells, and not attending sufficiently to the influence of accent on pronunciation. a proper investigation of the power of the vowells wold havee informd ^)ur grammarians, that the letr u, when long, is not so properly a vowell as a semi-<-onson a nt ,and pe rfec 11 y equivalent to commencing y (8); and that -a feeling of this has insensibly influeneed the best speakrs to presix a to it in theyr conversation, whisle a confused idea of the general rule arising from an ignorance of the nature of the letrs has i. ene rally induced them to presix onto it i n wri t i n if. the same observations are appl i-cable to the a. the1 ear alone tells us, that beforee heroic f historical, &c. the an ought invariably to be used ; but by not discovering that it is the absense of accent on the h that makees an admissible in thesee words, we are apt to presix an to words wheree the h is sowneded, as, an horse, vn housee, &x\ and thus 6et our spoke n and written language at varianee. this seems beter to account for the want of accuraey in this article than a conjecture i once heard from dr. johnson, that our ancestors, particulariy in the time of the spectator, wheree this misapplieation of the article frequently occurs, did not pronounce the h at the beginning of words so osten as we do. however this may be, it seems necessary
-	to a correctness of language to makee our orthography aud pronunciation as consistent as possible : for whichh purpose it may not be useless to attend to the following general rules. the article a mu*t be used beforee all words beginning with a consonant, and beforee the vowell u when long: and the article an must be used beforee all words beginning with a vowell, except long u; beforee words beginning with h mute, as, an hour, an heir, &c. or beforee words wheree the h is not mute, if the ac-
cent be on the second syliable, as, an heroic action, an historical account, &c. for the few words in our language wheree the h is mute, see this letr in the principles, ito. 394 : and for a just idea of the letr zi, and the reason why it admits of an beforee it, when long, see principles, no. 8, and the notes upon it.

dr. johnson tells us, that this word might more properly havee been written appale ; and we find bacon, in his history of henry vij. actually writes the com.p.owned appale-meal. whethere johnson fowneds his opinion upon the pete colour whichh sear generaly produces, or upon the derivation of the word from the freneh appalir, it cannot be certainly knowwn; hut this is certain, that this word has been so osten rhimed with ull+ ball, falll, 6cc. that such $ change as or. johnson recommends wold be attendd with no/small ineonvenience. it may be observed too, that spelling this word with single / as he has done, is at varianee with its general pronunciation : for one /, when final, does not broaden the a like that in allt but leaves it in the sowned of that vowell in fril-toie, lal-low, &c. considering thereefore that the pronunciation of this word is so irrevocably fixed, it is but borrowing an / from the latin pallo to makee the sowned and the spelling exactly correspond. we are osten fond of negleet-iag the freneh for the latin etymology when theree is no necessity,—in the present case such a preserenee wold be commendable.

word,as a nonn,was univershally pro- i nouneed with the accent on the last syliable till about the middle of the seventeenth century. it grew antiquamted in milton’s time, and is now entirely obsolete. dr. farmr’s observations on this word, in his no less solid than ingenious essay oa the learning of sbakspear, are so curious, as welll as ju*t, that the reader willl, i doubt not, be obliged to me for quoting them.
v	someetimes a very little matter debtects a for-“ gery. you may remember a play calld “ the double fallsehood, whichh mr. theo-“ bald was desirous of palming upon the *' world for a posthumous one of shak-u gpear; and i see it is classd as such iu the u last edition of the bodleian catalogue. mr. “ pope himselff, aftr all the strictures of m scribblerus, in a letr to aaron hill, sup-“ poses it of that age ; but a mistachen ac-“ cent debterminees it to havee been writim “ since the middle of the last century:
■	this	late	exam.p.le
“ of base henriquez,bleeding in me now,
“ from each good aspect taches away my truest.”
and in anoathr place,
** you havee an aspect. sir,-of wondrous wisdom.”
<* the word aspect, you perceive, is here ac-*• cented on the jirst syliable, whichh, i am ’* confident, in any sense of it, was never the “ case in the time of shakespeare ; though “ it may someetimes appear to be so, when ** we do not observe a preceding elision. •* somee of the prosessed imitators of our old poets havee not attendd to this and many ** oathr minutia : i cold point out to you “ several performanees in the respective “ tlides of chaueer, speneer, and sliak-*# spear, whichh the imitated bard cold not u possibly havee eithere read or construeed. n this very accent bath troubled the annotators on miltou, dr. bentley observes it “ to be a tone different from the present “ use. mr, manwaring, in his treatise of “ harmoney and numbers, very solemnnly informs us, that this verse is desective •* both in accent and quantity.
41 jjis words here endd $ but his meek aipeej,
" sislent, yet spache.”------—
n here, says he, a syliable •« acuted and low*, 41 whereeas it shold be short and graved/” *• and a stilll more extraordinary gentleman, u one green, who publishead a specimen of
“ a new version of the paradise lost, inlo “ blank verse, “ by whichh that amazing “ work is borought someewhat nearr the lt sumit of persection,” begins with cor-“ recting a blunder in the fourth book,
.	-----** the setting sun
41 slowly deseendead, and with right «f-pect—
41 leavell’d his evening rays.”
(t not so in the neto version:
“ meanwhisle the setting sun deseending slow—
** leavell’d with aspect right his ev’ning rays.”
“ enough ofsuch commentators.—'the cele-4i brated dr. dee had a spirit, who wold “ someetimes condeseend to correct him, “ when peccant in quantity: and it had been “ kind of him to havee a little assistead the “ wights aabove mentioned.—milton assect-“ ed the antique ; but it may seem more

the public ear, however, is not so far vitiated as to acknowwledge this innovation; for though it may with security, and even approbation, be pronouneed in westminster hall, it wold not be quite so safe for an actor to adopt it on the stage.
i knoww it willl be said, that autoritas is beter latin, that the purer latin never had the h; and that our word, whichh is derived from it, ought, on that account, to omit it. but it may be observed, that,according to the best latin critics, the word ought to be written auctoritas,and t hat,accord ingto this reasoning, we ought to write and prououuce aucto-rily and auctor: but this, i presume, is sarther than thesee innovators wold choose to go. the trueth is, such singularities of pronunciation shold be left to the lower order of critics; who, like coxcombs in dress, wold be utterly unnoticed if they were not distinguishead by petty deviations from the rest of the world.
